Installing Tensorflow/theano/keras provided you are working with anaconda and python 3.5.2!
so here it goes

-Below are the installation instructions (you will notice that only Keras needs to be installed, this is normal, since the Keras package integrates TensorFlow):

if()
  Linux and Mac users, please open your terminal.
  On Mac, the easiest way to open it is to press anywhere cmd + space, and then in the Spotlight Search you enter "terminal".
  On Linux, you will find it very easily, usually on the left side of your monitor.
  Then inside the terminal, copy-paste and enter the following line command:

      -conda install -c conda-forge keras
else if()
  Windows users, please open the anaconda prompt, which you can find this way:
  Windows Button in the lower left corner -> List of programs -> anaconda -> anaconda prompt
  Then inside the anaconda prompt, copy-paste and enter the following line command:

      -conda install -c conda-forge keras

install keras packages with pip, like:
      
      -pip install keras-applications
      
      -pip install keras-preprocessing
      
And you are ready to use and train YOUR NEURAL NETS!
